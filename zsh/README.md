# `zsh` files

Nearly everything is in `.zshrc`, and the [`ohmyzsh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) theme I added is in `readme.zsh-theme`. Once `ohmyzsh` is installed, you can install the theme by running the following from the root of this repo:

```sh
cp zsh/readme.zsh-theme $ZSH/themes/readme.zsh-theme
```
